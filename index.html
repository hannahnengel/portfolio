        <div class="col-5">
          <p>I am a marketing product management professional with a passion for people, culture, and collaborating with others to achieve common
          goals. I thrive with the fine print, actualizing projects to their fullest potential.
          </p>
          <p> <span> &#8593;</span> That’s what you would read off my resume, anyway. What you WON'T understand from my resume is my absolute passion for languages. Since I was young, I studied opera, singing in 5
          different languages (Italian, German, Spanish, French and English). I loved the French repertoire so much that I decided
          to take it to the next level and pursue it as a second major in college. I studied abroad in France, became fluent, and
          since then, my love for languages has only grown – I am in the process of learning German, and now, <span style="font-style: italic;">programming.</span>
          </p>
          <p>My decision to take on programming is a direct translation of my love for language and applying those skills in a
          meaningful way. After having been a marketing product manager in the consumer product industry for the past 3.5 years, I
          felt like I wasn’t living up to my full potential or using the skills that meant most to me (aside from proof-reading
          some French copy on packaging).</p>
          <p>Language is all about meaning. That is why my goal is to master programming so that each day I can wake up and feel the
          spark of breathing meaning into my interactions, what I do, and what I create – ultimately conveying languages which
          directly translate to functional websites or applications.</p>
